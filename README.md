# EY_Internship_Bank_Transactions_Dataset

This is a repostiory contain a preliminary analysis of a bank transactions dataset obtained from within Inidia. Here, I've conducted univariate and bivariate EDA and used different clustering techniques to identify similar groups  with two variable quantities.
This repository also contains my code for building a map plotting function that shows the geographic distribution of any variable adaptable to any dataset.
